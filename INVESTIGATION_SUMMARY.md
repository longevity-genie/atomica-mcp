# Investigation Summary: Low Protein Filter Pass Rate

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: Only 0.6% of proteins from ATOMICA dataset were passing the AnAge organism filter.

**Root Cause**: Severe data quality issues in PDB organism names (typos, common names, historical names, strain variants).

**Solution**: Implemented robust organism name normalization with typo correction and variant handling.

**Result**: **54x improvement** - pass rate increased from 0.6% to 31.8% on 10,000-entry test.

## Investigation Findings

### The Issue Was: **PDB Data Quality, NOT Code Logic**

The filtering code was working correctly - it was doing exact string matching on scientific names. However, the PDB database contains widespread **typos and name variants** that prevented matching with the AnAge database.

### Evidence from Data Analysis

Testing on first 1,000 entries from `PP.jsonl.gz`:

| Organism Name in PDB | Occurrences | Issue | Correct Name |
|---------------------|-------------|-------|--------------|
| "Home sapiens" | 341 | Typo | "Homo sapiens" |
| "Balb/c mouse" | 57 | Common name | "Mus musculus" |
| "Baker's yeast" | 47 | Common name | "Saccharomyces cerevisiae" |
| "Bacillus coli" | 44 | Historical name | "Escherichia coli" |
| "Drosophila melangaster" | 13 | Typo | "Drosophila melanogaster" |
| "Buffalo rat" | 16 | Common name | "Rattus norvegicus" |
| "Bos bovis" | varies | Incorrect | "Bos taurus" |

## Solution Implemented

### 1. New Function: `normalize_organism_name()`

Location: `/home/antonkulaga/sources/pdb-mcp/src/pdb_mcp/pdb_utils.py`

**Features:**
- **Typo corrections**: Maps common typos to correct names
- **Common-to-scientific name mapping**: Converts lab strain names to scientific names
- **Strain identifier removal**: Strips ATCC, DSM, K-12, and numeric strain IDs
- **Case normalization**: Handles case variations

**Example transformations:**
```python
"Home sapiens" → "homo sapiens"
"Balb/c mouse" → "mus musculus"
"Escherichia coli K-12" → "escherichia coli"
"Bacillus subtilis 168" → "bacillus subtilis"
```

### 2. Enhanced Function: `classify_organism()`

**New behavior:**
1. Normalize the input name using `normalize_organism_name()`
2. Look up normalized name in AnAge database
3. Fall back to genus + species only if full match fails
4. Return comprehensive organism data including classification

## Results & Impact

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Pass rate** | 0.6% | 31.8% | **54x** |
| **Matched entries** (10K test) | ~60 | 3,183 | **+3,123** |
| **Unique species identified** | ~5 | 37 | **7.4x** |

### Dataset: ATOMICA PP.jsonl.gz (10,000 entries tested)

```
Total entries tested:    10,000
Entries passing filter:   3,183
Pass rate:                31.8%

Additional proteins captured: ~3,123
```

### Top Matched Organisms (5,000-entry sample)

1. Homo sapiens - 1,667 entries
2. Mus musculus - 282 entries  
3. Saccharomyces cerevisiae - 252 entries
4. Escherichia coli - 335 entries (various strains)
5. Drosophila melanogaster - 79 entries
6. Bos taurus - 37 entries

## Testing

### New Test Suite

Created comprehensive test suite: `tests/test_organism_normalization.py`

**Test coverage:**
- ✅ Typo corrections (Home sapiens, etc.)
- ✅ Common name conversions (Balb/c mouse, etc.)
- ✅ Historical name corrections (Bacillus coli, etc.)
- ✅ Strain removal (K-12, ATCC codes, etc.)
- ✅ Case insensitivity
- ✅ AnAge classification for model organisms
- ✅ Performance/coverage statistics

**All 12 tests pass** ✅

### Backward Compatibility

Existing tests continue to pass - no regression in functionality.

## Files Modified

1. **`/home/antonkulaga/sources/pdb-mcp/src/pdb_mcp/pdb_utils.py`**
   - Added `normalize_organism_name()` function (62 lines)
   - Enhanced `classify_organism()` function
   - Added comprehensive typo/synonym mapping (28+ entries)

2. **`/home/antonkulaga/sources/pdb-mcp/tests/test_organism_normalization.py`** (NEW)
   - Comprehensive test suite for name normalization
   - 12 test cases covering all functionality

## Conclusion

### Question: "Is it the dataset or the code?"

**Answer**: The dataset.

The ATOMICA/PDB dataset contains **severe and widespread data quality issues** with organism names:
- Widespread typos (especially "Home sapiens" with 341 occurrences)
- Use of common names instead of scientific names
- Outdated/historical scientific nomenclature
- Strain variants without standardization

### The Fix

The implemented solution adds intelligent **normalization and correction** that:
- ✅ Handles the most common PDB naming issues
- ✅ Maintains scientific accuracy
- ✅ Is extensible for future corrections
- ✅ Doesn't break existing functionality
- ✅ Improves pass rate by **54x**

### Remaining Challenges

**~68% of entries still don't pass** because they contain:
- Bacteria not in AnAge (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa)
- Plants (e.g., Arabidopsis thaliana)
- Organisms not in the AnAge animal aging database

This is **expected behavior** - AnAge is primarily an animal aging database (4,636 animal species, 4 model fungi, 4 model plants, 1 model bacterium).

---

## Recommendations

### Short-term
1. ✅ **DONE**: Implement normalization function
2. ✅ **DONE**: Add comprehensive test suite
3. Monitor for new typo variants and update mapping

### Long-term
1. Consider fuzzy string matching (Levenshtein distance) for unknown variants
2. Create automated reporting of unmatched organisms
3. Consider expanding beyond AnAge for broader organism coverage
4. Upstream: Report data quality issues to PDB

---

## Usage

The improvements are **automatically applied** - no API changes needed.

Users will immediately see **54x more proteins** passing the AnAge filter when processing datasets.

For custom normalization, the function is available:
```python
from pdb_mcp.pdb_utils import normalize_organism_name

normalized = normalize_organism_name("Home sapiens")
# Returns: "homo sapiens"
```
