[cite\_start]Molecular interactions underlie nearly all biological processes, but most machine learning models treat molecules in isolation or specialize in a single type of interaction, such as protein-ligand or protein-protein binding[cite: 10]. [cite\_start]Here, we introduce **ATOMICA**, a geometric deep learning model that learns atomic-scale representations of intermolecular interfaces across five modalities, including **proteins, small molecules, metal ions, lipids, and nucleic acids**[cite: 11]. [cite\_start]ATOMICA is trained on **2,037,972 interaction complexes** using self-supervised denoising and masking to generate embeddings of interaction interfaces at the levels of atoms, chemical blocks, and molecular interfaces[cite: 12]. [cite\_start]ATOMICA's latent space is compositional and captures physicochemical features shared across molecular classes, enabling representations of new molecular interactions to be generated by **algebraically combining embeddings** of interaction interfaces[cite: 13]. [cite\_start]The representation quality of this space improves with increased data volume and modality diversity[cite: 14]. [cite\_start]As in pre-trained natural language models, this scaling law implies predictable gains in performance as structural datasets expand[cite: 15]. [cite\_start]We construct modality-specific interfaceome networks, termed **ATOMICANETS**, which connect proteins based on interaction similarity with ions, small molecules, nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins[cite: 16]. [cite\_start]By overlaying disease-associated proteins of 27 diseases onto ATOMICANETS, we find **strong associations for asthma in lipid networks and myeloid leukemia in ion networks**[cite: 17]. [cite\_start]We use ATOMICA to annotate the **dark proteome**—proteins lacking known function—by predicting 2,646 uncharacterized ligand-binding sites, including putative zinc finger motifs and transmembrane cytochrome subunits[cite: 18]. [cite\_start]We **experimentally confirm heme binding for five ATOMICA predictions** in the dark proteome[cite: 19]. [cite\_start]By modeling molecular interactions, ATOMICA opens new avenues for understanding and annotating molecular function at scale[cite: 20].

## Main

Molecular interactions influence all aspects of chemistry and biology. [cite\_start]Despite advances in structure prediction and molecular modeling, machine learning models model molecules in isolation or are restricted to a single type of molecular interaction (Fig. 1a)[cite: 25]. [cite\_start]Protein and nucleic acid models leverage sequence-based tokenization [1-5], whereas small molecules require atomic-scale modeling due to their lack of inherent sequential structure [6-11][cite: 26]. [cite\_start]Molecular interaction models lack generalizability across molecular modalities, with distinct architectures designed for protein-ligand binding affinity [12-16], binding site prediction [17-20], protein-peptide interactions [21-23], protein-protein interactions [24-29], and protein-RNA recognition [30-35][cite: 27]. [cite\_start]This siloed approach limits the ability to transfer knowledge across molecular classes, even though interactions among proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, and metal ions are governed by shared physicochemical principles[cite: 28]. [cite\_start]Generative models such as AlphaFold [36] and RosettaFold [37] generate structures of molecular complexes, but they do not explicitly learn representations of intermolecular interactions[cite: 29]. [cite\_start]A universal model for learning representations of molecular interactions would allow prediction of functional effects for uncharacterized molecules across molecular modalities[cite: 30].

[cite\_start]A universal model for molecular interactions needs to capture the geometry of intermolecular interactions, imposed by hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, $\pi$-stacking, electrostatic interactions, and other physicochemical principles[cite: 31]. [cite\_start]However, each type of interaction varies in binding affinity, interface size, chemical composition, and functional roles[cite: 32]. [cite\_start]For example, protein-protein interfaces are often large, with median surface areas around $2,000-4,000~\AA^2$, and are stabilized by multiple hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts[cite: 33]. [cite\_start]In contrast, protein-ligand binding sites are smaller, with median surface areas typically between 300 and $1,500~\AA^2$, and are shaped by high-affinity, highly specific binding pockets [37, 38][cite: 34]. [cite\_start]RNA and DNA interfaces introduce sequence-dependent constraints, and metal ions exhibit coordination-specific geometry[cite: 35].

[cite\_start]We introduce **ATOMICA**, an all-atom geometric deep learning model that learns representations of intermolecular complexes across five molecular modalities: **proteins, small molecules, metal ions, lipids, and nucleic acids**, encompassing eight interaction types[cite: 36]. [cite\_start]ATOMICA is trained on a dataset of **2,037,972 interaction complexes** (Fig. 1b) [cite: 37][cite\_start], including 1,747,710 small-molecule interaction complexes from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) [39] and 290,262 molecular complexes from Q-BioLiP and the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [40-42][cite: 37]. [cite\_start]The model uses a geometric, $SE(3)$-equivariant architecture and is trained with a self-supervised objective that combines **denoising of atomic coordinates and masked block identity prediction**[cite: 38]. [cite\_start]By learning from interactions that span proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, and metal ions, ATOMICA generalizes across molecular modalities[cite: 43]. [cite\_start]We validate this cross-modality generalization by demonstrating improved representation quality and predictive performance in low-data modalities, such as protein-nucleic acid interactions, compared to models trained on a single pair of interacting modalities[cite: 44].

[cite\_start]ATOMICA's representations identify critical residues at interaction interfaces by measuring the change in latent embedding when individual blocks are masked, highlighting residues involved in intermolecular contacts[cite: 45]. [cite\_start]The latent space organizes complexes according to chemical similarity, grouping interfaces with similar physicochemical properties, such as hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic interactions[cite: 46]. [cite\_start]The model encodes compositional relationships, allowing **algebraic operations in the latent space between binding partners**, analogous to the semantic composition of natural language word embeddings[cite: 47]. [cite\_start]We use ATOMICA to construct **interfaceome networks** from predicted interactions among 5,856 protein-small molecule, 6,458 protein-ion, 6,649 protein-nucleic acid, 6,766 protein-lipid, and 17,158 protein-protein interfaces [43, 44][cite: 48]. [cite\_start]These networks reveal **27 disease-associated pathways** in ion, lipid, and small molecule networks, and identify candidate targets for autoimmune neuropathies[cite: 49]. [cite\_start]We apply ATOMICA to the **dark proteome**—regions of the proteome without functional annotation [45-47][cite: 50]. [cite\_start]ATOMICA predicts **2,646 ligand-binding sites** with putative ion or cofactor specificity, suggesting molecular functions in previously uncharacterized protein families[cite: 51]. [cite\_start]We experimentally confirm **heme binding for five dark proteins** using recombinant expression and spectroscopic assays[cite: 52].

## Results

### Dataset of molecular interactions for proteins, small molecules, ions, lipids, and nucleic acids.

[cite\_start]We assembled a dataset of interacting molecular entities from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) v2022.3.0 [39] and Q-BioLiP [40,41] which contains intermolecular interactions across all modalities available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB)[cite: 55]. [cite\_start]From the CSD, we filtered for entries of small molecule crystals and extracted unique pairs of conformers from the unit cell (Methods 1), resulting in **1,767,710 interacting pairs of small molecules**[cite: 56]. [cite\_start]We also processed **337,993 interaction complexes from Q-BioLiP**, which includes structures of protein complexes with proteins, DNA, RNA, peptides, small molecules, and metal ions, as well as nucleic acid ligand structures from the PDB[cite: 57]. [cite\_start]The interaction interface between two entities is defined by atoms within an $8~\AA$ distance to the other molecule to capture atoms in intermolecular bonds and the surrounding molecular context[cite: 58]. [cite\_start]For protein and nucleic acid containing complexes, we model only the amino acids and nucleic acids at the interface[cite: 59, 61, 63].

[cite\_start]We represent interaction complexes using **two-level graphs** that represent atomic-level details and higher-order chemical structures (Fig. 1c)[cite: 64]. [cite\_start]At the first level, nodes in the graph represent **atoms**, each defined by its element type and 3D spatial coordinates[cite: 65]. [cite\_start]At the second level, atoms are grouped into chemically meaningful **blocks**, such as amino acids in proteins, nucleotides in nucleic acids, and functional moieties in small molecules, to form a block-level graph [48-50][cite: 66]. [cite\_start]This hierarchical graph representation of intermolecular interactions captures local atomic interactions and broader structural organization and has theoretically higher expressive power than atom-level graphs alone [51][cite: 67]. [cite\_start]Within each graph level, we define two types of edges: **intramolecular edges** connect the $k$ nearest nodes in Euclidean space within each molecule, and **intermolecular edges** connect the $k$ nearest nodes in Euclidean space on the interface of interacting molecules[cite: 68].

### ATOMICA: Geometric deep learning model of intermolecular interactions at atomic scale.

[cite\_start]ATOMICA is a self-supervised geometric graph neural network that generates **multi-scale embeddings at the atom, block, and graph level** from the structure of interacting two molecules (Fig. 1c)[cite: 70]. [cite\_start]Unlike modality-specific models, ATOMICA generates embeddings at the interface for any complex of interacting molecular modalities (small molecules, metal ions, amino acids, and nucleic acids) (Fig. 1b)[cite: 71]. [cite\_start]ATOMICA can also be adapted by adding a task adaptor head and finetuning ATOMICA and the head for specific predictive tasks such as binding site annotation[cite: 72]. [cite\_start]Embeddings are learned through $SE(3)$-equivariant tensor field networks for message passing between nodes via the intermolecular and intramolecular edges (Methods 2)[cite: 73].

[cite\_start]To train ATOMICA, we use **self-supervised pretraining objectives combining denoising and masked block prediction**[cite: 75]. [cite\_start]In ATOMICA, denoising requires the model to reconstruct an interaction complex graph after it has been perturbed by a rigid $SE(3)$ transformation and random torsion angle rotations of one molecular entity at the interface (Fig. 1e)[cite: 77]. [cite\_start]This objective forces the model to learn the spatial relationships and physicochemical constraints that define intermolecular interactions, rather than memorizing specific atomic coordinates[cite: 78]. [cite\_start]ATOMICA is also trained to identify the type of randomly masked chemical blocks at the interaction interface[cite: 79]. [cite\_start]This masking objective encourages the model to infer missing chemical context based on the surrounding interface environment[cite: 84].

### ATOMICA captures multi-scale relationships and composition of interacting molecules.

[cite\_start]Visualizing ATOMICA embeddings at the graph level in 2D with UMAP for all interaction complexes shows that the embeddings capture **relative chemical similarity** of molecular interactions (Fig. 1f)[cite: 87]. [cite\_start]The latent space of atom embeddings is organized according to **periodic table location** when projected into 2D with principal component analysis (PCA) (Fig. 2a)[cite: 89]. [cite\_start]For PCA projections of block embeddings, the latent space organization resembles the **chemical properties of the amino acids**, which are also distinct from DNA and RNA nucleotides (Fig. 2b)[cite: 90].

[cite\_start]We draw inspiration from the latent space properties of functional gene embeddings [65] and natural language embeddings in models such as word2vec, where algebraic relationships like $\vec{King}-\vec{Man}+\vec{Woman}$ yield an embedding close to $\vec{Queen}$ [66, 67][cite: 93]. [cite\_start]To test for similar **compositionality**, we evaluate the relationship: $\text{ATOMICA Semantic Vector} = \vec{\text{Protein A, Small Molecule X}} - \vec{\text{Protein A}} + \vec{\text{Protein B}} \approx \vec{\text{Protein B, Small Molecule X}}$ (Fig. 2c)[cite: 94]. [cite\_start]For unseen protein-NAD complexes, the Semantic Vectors are significantly closer to the true embeddings of protein B-NAD complexes than to randomly chosen protein-small molecule complexes (KS statistic 0.599, $p\text{-value} < 0.001$, Fig. 2d)[cite: 95].

### ATOMICA identifies residues on interaction interfaces involved in intermolecular bonds.

[cite\_start]Zero-shot probing of ATOMICA shows it learns to differentiate between blocks involved in **intermolecular bonds** (hydrogen bonding, $\pi$-stacking, hydrophobic interactions) against other blocks present at the interface (Fig. 2e)[cite: 101]. [cite\_start]We define **$\text{ATOMICA}_{\text{SCORE}}$** for block $i$ as the cosine similarity between the ATOMICA embedding of the interaction complex graph with block $i$ masked out and without masking (Fig. 2f)[cite: 102]. [cite\_start]The blocks where masking causes the largest change in the representation have the lowest $\text{ATOMICA}_{\text{SCORE}}$ (Methods 6)[cite: 103]. [cite\_start]For an unseen test set of protein-small molecule complexes, $\text{ATOMICA}_{\text{SCORE}}$ achieves the highest performance in retrieving amino acid blocks involved in intermolecular bonds in the top 10 nominated blocks, retrieving an average of 2.7, followed by ESM-2 (3B) with 2.4, and the random reference with 2.0[cite: 105].

### Scaling laws drive generalizability of ATOMICA across molecular modalities.

[cite\_start]Pretraining ATOMICA across all modalities **improves prediction accuracy for masked blocks** in low-data modalities[cite: 110, 108]. [cite\_start]For protein-DNA interfaces (2,253 training complexes), the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) increases from 0.24 to 0.71 (a 190% increase)[cite: 110]. [cite\_start]For protein-RNA interfaces (2,975 training complexes), performance increases from 0.19 to 0.55 AUPRC[cite: 111]. [cite\_start]The improvements in AUPRC **scale with dataset size** (Fig. 2k)[cite: 113]. [cite\_start]This illustrates a **scaling law**: as the diversity and volume of interaction data increase, representation quality and predictive performance systematically improve[cite: 114].

### Building interfaceome networks for five molecular modalities.

[cite\_start]Disruptions in networks of interacting molecules often underlie disease [71][cite: 124]. [cite\_start]We study disease pathways with ATOMICA by analyzing protein interactions with ions, small molecules, nucleic acids, lipids, and other proteins[cite: 127]. [cite\_start]ATOMICA-Interface is finetuned from ATOMICA for the embedding of protein interfaces (Methods 4)[cite: 129]. [cite\_start]The putative interfaceome is obtained from predicted protein binding sites across **23,391 AlphaFold2 predicted protein structures** in the human proteome [18] (Methods 4)[cite: 130]. [cite\_start]One **$\text{ATOMICA}_{\text{NET}}$** is constructed for each interacting modality, where nodes are proteins and edges connect proteins with **high ATOMICA similarity** between their modality-specific binding interfaces (Fig. 3a)[cite: 131]. [cite\_start]The probability of pairs of nodes being involved in the same disease is higher if the two nodes have higher ATOMICA interface similarity (Fig. 3b)[cite: 132].

The largest connected component (LCC) for each network is:

  * [cite\_start]$\text{ATOMICA}_{\text{NET}}\text{-Ion}$: 5,831 proteins[cite: 133].
  * [cite\_start]$\text{ATOMICA}_{\text{NET}}\text{-Small-Molecule}$: 5,246 proteins[cite: 133].
  * [cite\_start]$\text{ATOMICA}_{\text{NET}}\text{-Nucleic-Acid}$: 5,974 proteins[cite: 133].
  * [cite\_start]$\text{ATOMICA}_{\text{NET}}\text{-Lipid}$: 6,055 proteins[cite: 133].
  * [cite\_start]$\text{ATOMICA}_{\text{NET}}\text{-Protein}$: 15,450 proteins[cite: 133].

[cite\_start]The edges in the $\text{ATOMICA}_{\text{NET}}$s are distinct from physical protein-protein interactions [79], with the average overlap in edges across the five $\text{ATOMICA}_{\text{NET}}$s with PPI networks being 2.7%[cite: 134].

### Examining disease pathways in interfaceome-based $\text{ATOMICA}_{\text{NET}}$ networks.

[cite\_start]For diseases with at least 25 proteins in an $\text{ATOMICA}_{\text{NET}}$ [71], the average size of the largest pathway component (proportion of disease-associated proteins in the LCC of the disease pathway [80]) for $\text{ATOMICA}_{\text{NET}}$s are: Ion 11%, Small-Molecule 11%, Lipid 16%, Nucleic-Acid 10%, and Protein 6% (Fig. 3c)[cite: 141].

  * [cite\_start]In **$\text{ATOMICA}_{\text{NET}}\text{-Lipid}$**, **Asthma** has an observable disease pathway (Fig 3d, $p\text{-value} < 0.001$)[cite: 146]. [cite\_start]The pathway involves proteins sharing similar transmembrane domains [cite: 147][cite\_start], including ten sodium channel family proteins and G protein-coupled receptors (adenosine, $\alpha/\beta$-adrenergic, muscarinic, and histamine receptors)[cite: 148, 149]. [cite\_start]These clusters form key interactions with $\text{PIP}_2$, a minority lipid component of the cell membrane[cite: 151].
  * [cite\_start]In **$\text{ATOMICA}_{\text{NET}}\text{-Ion}$**, **Myeloid leukemia** has 53 disease-associated proteins (Fig 3e), of which 12 are in the largest component ($p\text{-value} < 0.001$)[cite: 156]. [cite\_start]This component includes **TET2**, a $\text{Fe}^{2+}$ binder, and four DNA binding proteins with similar ATOMICA embeddings that possess zinc finger domains[cite: 157, 158].
  * [cite\_start]In **$\text{ATOMICA}_{\text{NET}}\text{-Small-Molecule}$**, **Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy** has 45 associated proteins (Fig 3f), with the largest pathway component of size 7 ($p\text{-value} = 0.037$)[cite: 161]. [cite\_start]Proteins connected here share **nucleotide (GTP/GDP, ATP/ADP) binding sites**, including myosin heavy chain proteins ($\text{MYH}6, \text{MYH}7\text{B}$), cardiac actin ($\text{ACTC}1$), and HRAS, a GTPase[cite: 162, 163].

### $\text{ATOMICA}_{\text{NET}}$ associates lipid and ion interacting targets for autoimmune channelopathies.

[cite\_start]For **multiple sclerosis (MS)** and **autoimmune peripheral neuropathy (APN)**, a diffusion-based network approach [94] applied to $\text{ATOMICA}_{\text{NET}}\text{-Ion}$ and $\text{ATOMICA}_{\text{NET}}\text{-Lipid}$ identified disease-associated proteins[cite: 170, 178, 179]. [cite\_start]**KCNA1 and KCNA2**, voltage-gated potassium channels [95], were consistently top-ranked candidates in 100% of random walks for both MS and APN in $\text{ATOMICA}_{\text{NET}}\text{-Ion}$[cite: 180]. [cite\_start]$\text{ATOMICA}_{\text{NET}}\text{-Lipid}$ also detected KCNA1 (70% hit rate for MS, 83% for APN) and KCNA2 (100% for MS and APN)[cite: 181].

### Ligand annotation of ion and cofactor binding sites in the dark proteome.

[cite\_start]The **dark proteome** comprises regions of the proteome without functional annotation [45-47][cite: 187]. [cite\_start]We finetune ATOMICA-Ligand from ATOMICA to annotate ligands to binding sites and apply it to proteins in dark clusters[cite: 191]. [cite\_start]ATOMICA-Ligand predicts ion and small molecule identities from protein pockets of PDB structures for **9 metal ions and 12 commonly found cofactors** (Fig. 4b, Methods 5)[cite: 199]. [cite\_start]The quality of ATOMICA-Ligand predictions is confirmed with AlphaFold3 ipTM scores of the complexes, which are statistically significantly higher than reference complexes for both ions (KS Statistic: 0.11, $p\text{-value} < 0.001$) and small molecules (KS Statistic: 0.54, $p\text{-value} < 0.001$) (Fig. 4c)[cite: 203].

  * [cite\_start]ATOMICA-Ligand predicts $\text{Mg}^{2+}$ (score 0.76) for **A0A0M0BG38** (Fig. 4d), which sequence-based prediction suggests is a phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase, an enzyme that is $\text{Mg}^{2+}$-dependent[cite: 207, 209, 210].
  * [cite\_start]It annotates $\text{Zn}^{2+}$ for uncharacterized bacterial clusters **A0A6C0E0P4** (Fig. 4e) and **A0A7Y4VG56** (Fig. 4f), predicting them to be metallopeptidases[cite: 211, 712]. [cite\_start]The predicted $\text{Zn}^{2+}$-binding site contains the conserved **HEXXH motif**[cite: 214, 215].
  * [cite\_start]It characterizes a **C4 zinc finger motif** in **W8VVQ2** (Fig. 4g) as $\text{Zn}^{2+}$ binding (score 0.98), suggesting a putative novel class of bacterial C4 zinc fingers with endonuclease function[cite: 221, 223, 229].
  * [cite\_start]It identifies **heme binding** for two ancient clusters, **A0A6B2YTG2 (TG2)** and **A0A0K3BHV0 (HV0)** (Fig. 4h), suggesting they are putative transmembrane cytochrome proteins[cite: 231, 232, 233].

### Experimental validation of heme binders predicted by ATOMICA.

[cite\_start]We experimentally confirmed heme binding for **five out of six** proteins predicted by ATOMICA-Ligand to be heme-binding (Methods 7.2)[cite: 248]. [cite\_start]Confirmation was done by observing a **red-shift in the Soret band from 390 nm** for free heme using UV-Vis spectroscopy (Fig. 5a)[cite: 247].

[cite\_start]Four of the confirmed proteins—A0A7W1B5T5 (score 0.997), A0A2V6P8N7 (0.690), A0A7W0X6V6 (0.992), and A0A1T4N4K0 (0.874)—were predicted to exhibit covalent heme binding and have the $\text{CXXCH}$ motif common in cytochrome C proteins[cite: 249, 250]. [cite\_start]The fifth confirmed protein, **V5BF69** (0.663) (Fig. 5f), **does not contain the canonical $\text{CXXCH}$ heme binding motif**, demonstrating ATOMICA-Ligand can identify novel heme-binding motifs not predictable by sequence motifs alone[cite: 252, 255].

## Discussion

[cite\_start]ATOMICA is a geometric deep learning model that represents intermolecular interactions by learning from **over two million complexes** involving small molecules, metal ions, amino acids, and nucleic acids[cite: 257]. [cite\_start]Its embeddings generalize across interaction types and exhibit **compositionality** in the latent space[cite: 258]. [cite\_start]By constructing **ATOMICANETS**, it reveals **disease modules across 27 diseases** and identifies disease-associated proteins[cite: 260]. [cite\_start]ATOMICA extends to the **dark proteome**, predicting and functionally annotating ion and cofactor binding sites [cite: 261][cite\_start], with experimental validation of heme binding for five proteins[cite: 266].

[cite\_start]A limitation of ATOMICA is its **dependence on high-resolution molecular structures**[cite: 267]. [cite\_start]The applicability of ATOMICA is expanded by advances like AlphaFold3 and RoseTTAFold, which generate high-confidence models[cite: 269]. [cite\_start]However, structural databases still **underrepresent flexible regions** like intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which are critical for cellular regulation[cite: 270, 271]. [cite\_start]Integrating sequence-based features could improve representations in these structurally ambiguous regions[cite: 274]. [cite\_start]Another limitation is the **relatively small size of structural datasets** compared to proximity-based interaction screening datasets, suggesting that incorporating these large-scale interaction data types would extend ATOMICA's applicability[cite: 275, 278].

[cite\_start]ATOMICA creates opportunities for new applications, such as predicting the effects of sequence variation on binding interfaces[cite: 281]. [cite\_start]The compositional latent space supports the **repurposing of ligands, cofactors, and binding domains**[cite: 282]. [cite\_start]It can also serve as a foundation for **generative models** that design interacting molecules, and facilitate **multitarget optimization** in drug design by embedding protein interfaces independent of specific ligands[cite: 283, 288].
